This is a maven project, I was having trouble getting it to run in VSC but it should work fine in a IDE like IntelliJ.

To run the program and test functionality, simply open two terminals and enter the following command "mvn compile exec:java"

If a feature isn't working correctly please restart the program, I was having some issues with multithreading and couldn't get it fixed in time.
